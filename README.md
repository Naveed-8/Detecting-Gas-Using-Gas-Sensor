# Detecting-Gas-Using-Gas-Sensor
It detects gas or smoke using a gas sensor with Arduino and to indicate the level of threat using LEDs and Piezo Buzzer. This detector uses a gas sensor and detects the presence of any gas or smoke leakage in an exceedingly domestic and work places and immediately alerts the environment. The sensors are widely used across the world to detect any presence of gases such as propane gas, iso-butane gas, Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG) and smoke. The gas sensor detects the gas/smoke in any closed surroundings. It detects the intensity/concentration of the gas released/leaked. The value of concentration will be read by the analog pin. Based on that reading The LED bulbs will glow. If the Gas is highly concentrated the Red LED will glow and the piezo buzzer will make the sound. If the gas is moderately intense then the Yellow LED will glow and if the gas is far from the gas sensor the Green LED will glow. The piezo buzzer will not make any sound in both the previous cases.
